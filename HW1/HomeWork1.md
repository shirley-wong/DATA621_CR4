# Overview {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
In this homework assignment, you will explore, analyze and model a data set containing approximately 2200 records. Each record represents a professional baseball team from the years 1871 to 2006 inclusive. Each record has the performance of the team for the given year, with all of the statistics adjusted to match the performance of a 162 game season.

We have been given a dataset with 2276 records summarizing a major league baseball team's season. The records span 1871 to 2006 inclusive. All statistics have been adjusted to match the performance of a 162 game season.

Your objective is to build a multiple linear regression model on the training data to predict the number of wins for the team. You can only use the variables given to you (or variables that you derive from the variables provided).

# Deliverables {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
- A write-up submitted in PDF format. Your write-up should have four sections. Each one is described below. You may assume you are addressing me as a fellow data scientist, so do not need to shy away from technical details.
- Assigned predictions (the number of wins for the team) for the evaluation data set.
- Include your R statistical programming code in an Appendix.



# DATA EXPLORATION 

The data set describes baseball team statistics for the years 1871 to 2006 inclusive. Each record in the data set represents the performance of the team for the given year adjusted to the current length of the season - 162 games. The data set includes 16 variables and the training set includes 2,276 records.

Load the data and understand the data by using some stats and plott

```r
mtd <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rajwantmishra/DATA621_CR4/master/HW1/Deb/moneyball-training-data.csv")
med <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rajwantmishra/DATA621_CR4/master/HW1/Deb/moneyball-evaluation-data.csv")
```

## View rows and columns, variable types

Glimpse of the data shows that all variables are numeric, no ctegorical variable is present here. We do lots of NA for few predcitors in the data set. In our further analysis we will try to identify :

+ Structure of the each predictors 
+ How Many NA and Zero , is it significant to remove them or replace them with some predicted value. 
+ Statistical summary of the data

`BATTING_HBP` is showing very close mean and median vlaue, and we suspect its due less number of datapoints. Remember we noted highest number of NA in this predictor.  Apart from `FIELDING_E` we don't see any big differnce in the mean and median of the data. 

## Rename Columns

Here we removing the `TEAM_` from the column name so that we can display it in the plots, and make it easy to read. 

Names Before: INDEX, TARGET_WINS, TEAM_BATTING_H, TEAM_BATTING_2B, TEAM_BATTING_3B, TEAM_BATTING_HR, TEAM_BATTING_BB, TEAM_BATTING_SO, TEAM_BASERUN_SB, TEAM_BASERUN_CS, TEAM_BATTING_HBP, TEAM_PITCHING_H, TEAM_PITCHING_HR, TEAM_PITCHING_BB, TEAM_PITCHING_SO, TEAM_FIELDING_E, TEAM_FIELDING_DP <br>


```r
train <- mtd
test <- med
train$INDEX <- NULL
test$INDEX <- NULL

cleanNames <- function(train) {
    name_list <- names(train)
    name_list <- gsub("TEAM_", "", name_list)
    names(train) <- name_list
    train
}

mtd <- cleanNames(train)
med <- cleanNames(test)
```

Names After : TARGET_WINS, BATTING_H, BATTING_2B, BATTING_3B, BATTING_HR, BATTING_BB, BATTING_SO, BASERUN_SB, BASERUN_CS, BATTING_HBP, PITCHING_H, PITCHING_HR, PITCHING_BB, PITCHING_SO, FIELDING_E, FIELDING_DP

## Visualize the data


```r
mtd %>%
  gather(variable, value, TARGET_WINS:FIELDING_DP) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(value)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "indianred4", color="indianred4") + 
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales ="free", ncol = 4) +
  labs(x = element_blank(), y = element_blank())
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

In the histogram plot above, we see that the batting, pitching home-run and batting strike-out variables are bi modal. `TARGET_WINS` and `TEAM_BATTING_2B` has most the normal distribution. `PITCHING_H` and `PITCHING_SO` have the most skewed data distribution. The skewed graphs are all rght-skewed except `BATTING_BB`.


```r
scatterplot3d(mtd$TARGET_WINS, mtd$BATTING_2B, mtd$BATTING_BB, pch = 20, highlight.3d = TRUE, type = "h", main = "3D ScatterPlots")
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

The above 3-D scatter plot, shows the data variance between the `TARGET_WINS`, `TEAM_BATTING_2B` and `TEAM_BATTING_BB` to provide a comparative 3D view.

##  Multivariate Plot

We will evalaute ``Frequency (Histogram of Variables)`` and ``Regression fit`` of each predictors with `TARGET_WIN`.


```r
par(mfrow=c(3,3))   
for (i in 1:16) {
      hist(mtd[,i],main=names(mtd[i]),xlab=names(mtd[i]),breaks = 51)
      boxplot(mtd[,i], main=names(mtd[i]), type="l",horizontal = TRUE)
      
      plot(mtd[,i], mtd$TARGET_WINS, main = names(mtd[i]), xlab=names(mtd[i]))
      abline(lm(mtd$TARGET_WINS ~ mtd[,i], data = mtd), col = "blue")
}
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-2.png)<!-- -->![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-3.png)<!-- -->![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-4.png)<!-- -->![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-5.png)<!-- -->![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-6.png)<!-- -->

As can be seen from above histogram, boxplot and scatter plot with regression line shows the spread of the data points. More than half of the variables show skewness. A box-cox transformation may help to mitigate the skewness. Plot also shows very few variables are normally distributed.

## Missing or NA Values

We are trying to see how many `NA` is present  in the dataset. 


```r
mtd %>% 
  gather(variable, value) %>%
  filter(is.na(value)) %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(percent = n / nrow(mtd) * 100) %>%
  mutate(percent = paste0(round(percent, ifelse(percent < 10, 1, 0)), "%")) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

As can be inferred from above, there are very few zero values exists.

## Checking for outliers

```r
ggplot(stack(mtd), aes(x = ind, y = values)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2500)) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey'))
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

The box plots reveal that a great majority of the explanatory variables have high variances. Many of the medians and means are also not aligned which demonstrates the outliers' effects.

The variance of some of the explanatory variables greatly exceeds the variance of the response "win" variable. The dataset has many outlines with some observations that are more extreme than the 1.5 * IQR of the box plot whiskers.

## Checking for skewness in the data

```r
melt(mtd) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= value)) +
    geom_density(fill='red') + facet_wrap(~variable, scales = 'free')
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

As per above, there are several variables like `PITCHING_H`, `PITCHING_BB`, `PITCHING_SO` and `FIELDING_E` are extremely skewed as there are many outliers.

## Finding correlations

Below shows the comparative correlations between the 16 variables as it shows the correlation coefficients and thus find correlated variables. Whichever adhere to a fitted straight red line well, ie. change in synch with each other. If the points lie close to the line but the line is curved, it's good nonlinear association and one can still be defined by other. Each individual plot shows the relationship between the variable in the horizontal vs the vertical of the grid. Each individual plot shows the relationship between the variable in the horizontal vs the vertical of the grid, whereas the diagonal is showing a histogram of each variable.

## Missing value by Graph
Here will see how much of data is missing in each predictors. 


```r
vis_miss(mtd)
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)<!-- -->

Here from the plots we can see  outliers in PITCHING_H,PITCHING_BB and PITCHING_SO 

Also, since BATTING_H is a combination of BATTING_2B, BATTING_3B, BATTING_HR (and also includes batted singles), we will create a new variable BATTING_1B equaling BATTING_H - BATTING_2B - BATTING_3B - BATTING_HR and after creating this we will remove BATTING_H

## Initial Observations

>>
- Response variable (TARGET_WINS) looks to be normally distributed which means there are good teams, bad teams as well as average teams.
- There are also quite a few variables with missing values. We may need to deal with these in order to have the largest data set possible for modeling.
- A couple variables are bimodal (TEAM_BATTING_HR, TEAM_BATTING_SO, TEAM_PITCHING_HR). This may be a challenge as some of them are missing values and that may be a challenge in filling in missing values.
- Some variables are right skewed (TEAM_BASERUN_CS, TEAM_BASERUN_SB, etc.). This might support the good team theory. It may also introduce non-normally distributed residuals in the model. We shall see.
- Dataset covers a wide time period spanning across multiple "eras" of baseball. 

# DATA PREPARATION

## Fixing Missing/Zero Values

+ Remove the invalid data and prepare it for imputation. 

+ We could "discard" the `TEAM_BATTING_HBP`,due to the `high percentage of missing data`; particularly, replacing it by "ZERO" should not be advisable since the minimum value recorded is 29 and replacing it with a median value would not be much helpful due to high percentage of missing values. *We decided not to consider this variable for our study*.

+ A typical professional league baseball game has 9 innings (extra innings come to play in the event of a tie) in length, and in each inning one can only pitch 3 strikeouts. There have been a maximum of 27 potential strikeouts upto a maximum of by 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months in Major League Baseball (MLB) season. Therefore having more than 4374 strikeouts (9x3x162) is not possible. Incidentally, the maximum strikeouts in any baseball season has been 513 by Matt Kilroy in the year 1886	as part of Baltimore Orioles within American Association League.


```r
remove_bad_values <- function(df){
  # Change 0's to NA so they too can be imputed
  df <- df %>% mutate(BATTING_SO = ifelse(BATTING_SO == 0, NA, BATTING_SO))
  
  # Remove the high pitching strikeout values
  df[which(df$PITCHING_SO > 4374),"PITCHING_SO"] <- NA
  
  # Drop the hit by pitcher variable
  df %>% select(-BATTING_HBP)
}
mtd <- remove_bad_values(mtd)
med <- remove_bad_values(med) %>% na.omit()
```

## Imputing the values using KNN

*K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* : K Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm that is useful for matching a point with its closest k neighbors in a multi-dimensional space. Therefore, a point value can be approximated by the values of the points that are closest to it, based on other variables.

  The KNN imputation algorithm helps in imputing missing data by finding the k closest neighbors to the observation with missing data and then imputing them based on the the non-missing values in the neighbors. Most common method used for KNN is weighted mean


```r
set.seed(42)
knn <- mtd %>% DMwR::knnImputation()
impute_values <- function(df, knn){
  impute_me <- is.na(df$BATTING_SO)
  df[impute_me,"BATTING_SO"] <- knn[impute_me,"BATTING_SO"] 
  impute_me <- is.na(df$BASERUN_SB)
  df[impute_me,"BASERUN_SB"] <- knn[impute_me,"BASERUN_SB"] 
  impute_me <- is.na(df$BASERUN_CS)
  df[impute_me,"BASERUN_CS"] <- knn[impute_me,"BASERUN_CS"] 
  impute_me <- is.na(df$PITCHING_SO)
  df[impute_me,"PITCHING_SO"] <- knn[impute_me,"PITCHING_SO"]
  impute_me <- is.na(df$FIELDING_DP)
  df[impute_me,"FIELDING_DP"] <- knn[impute_me,"FIELDING_DP"]
  return(df)
}
imputed_mtd_Data <- impute_values(mtd, knn)
```

As can be observed from above KNN imputation (result table below ), the models did not behave favorably resulting in high RMSE and low R squared which results in poor prediction due to generation of highly correlated data.

| Model Name | RMSE    | R^2      |
|------------|---------|----------|
| model1     | 13.1079 | 0.271328 |
| model2     | 13.2033 | 0.26092  |
| model3     | 13.1079 | 0.27133  |
| model4     | 13.3301 | 0.24664  |
| model5     | 13.2601 | 0.25328  |
| model6     | 13.0805 | 0.27403  |

Since `BATTING_H` is a combination of `BATTING_2B`, `BATTING_3B`, `BATTING_HR` (and also includes batted singles), we will create a new variable `BATTING_1B` equaling `BATTING_H - BATTING_2B - BATTING_3B - BATTING_HR` and after creating this we will remove `BATTING_H`


```r
# Including batting singles
add_features <- function(df){
  df %>%
    mutate(BATTING_1B = BATTING_H - BATTING_2B - BATTING_3B - BATTING_HR)
}

mtd <- add_features(mtd)
med <- add_features(med)
```

# BUILD MODELS

It does a fairly good job predicting, but there are a lot of variables that are not statistically significant. We see the that P-value is less than .05 which makes it one of the possible model but not all the coefficients of the `model1` are significant. 

### Plot

```r
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model1)
```

From the above residual plots let's analyze if the assumptions of our model is correct or not:

1)  The variability of the points is approximately the same in the mid values of x with the decrese of variations towards the two end points which depicts that the plot is unbaised and homoscedastic except for few outliers.

2) Normal q-q plot fulfills the assumptions of normality.

But since few coefficients of the model are not significant, let's see if assumptions of other models are true.

                 "AIC" = glance(model2)$AIC,
                 "Note"= "All are significant"))
```

For model 2, since we have only considered significant values from model 1, Multiple R-squared value is 0.39 which is a good representation that our model fits the data. 

This model also does a good job predicting, and all variables are statistically significant. 

### Plot

From the above residual plots let's analyze if the assumptions of our model is correct or not:

1)  The variability of the points is approximately the same throughout the values of x which depicts that this plot is also unbaised and homoscedastic with very few(minimum) outliers.

2) Normal q-q plot fulfills the assumptions of normality.

From the above points , assumptions of model 2 is true, let's see if assumptions of our next models are true.

## Model 3 : Higher Order Stepwise Regression

Only taking the variable from the Model1 that are really significant.

As we see above, in Model3a in which "BATTING_3B,FIELDING_E ,BATTING_2B,FIELDING_DP" are significant and are considered in the model. We get Multiple R-squared as 0.17.

In Model3b we chose "BATTING_3B + FIELDING_E + BATTING_2B + FIELDING_DP" as they are significant coefficients in model3a. We get Multiple R-squared as 0.11

Further reducing the variables(TEAM_PITCHING_SO and TEAM_BATTING_SO are having high correlation, TEAM_BATTING_H and TEAM_PITCHING_H are also having high correlation, TEAM_BATTING_SO and TEAM_PITCHING_SO are also having high correlation):

```

For Model3, we take quadratic equation of predictors to analyze if multicollinearity exist . As we see, p-value is significant, so multicollinearity exist between the predictors.

### Plot Model3, Model3a, Model3b


```r
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model3,which = c(1,2,3,4), caption = list("Model 3"))
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
plot(model3a,which = c(1,2,3,4), caption = list("Model 3a"))
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-2.png)<!-- -->

```r
plot(model3b,which = c(1,2,3,4), caption = list("Model 3b"))
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-3.png)<!-- -->

From the above residual plots let's analyze if the assumptions of our model is correct or not:

**Model3:**

1)  The variability of the points is approximately the same throughout the values of x with some outliers towards for the ends and the variability also differes in two ends. We can say that the model is homoscedastic.
2) Normal q-q plot fulfills the assumptions of normality with the exception of outliers.

**Model3a :**

"BATTING_3B,FIELDING_E ,BATTING_2B,FIELDING_DP 

1) Among the ponts scattered, variability of few points are not constant throughout.

2) Normal q-q plot fulfills the assumptions of normality with the exception of outliers.

**Model3b :**

For Model3b, we choose the significant variables from model3a, 

1) The points scattered does not have a constant variability, which shows that the assumptions of this model does not hold true

# SELECT MODELS 

We have created couple of models in the last step, let's review the result for each of our model:

### Multicolinearity 

Lets Evaluate if we have any multicolinearity in our model1s.Multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a statistical phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a non-trivial degree of accuracy.

We will user alias function to detect the collinearity of all the predictor in the model1. 

#### Model 1

```r
alias(model1)
```

```
## Model :
## TARGET_WINS ~ BATTING_H + BATTING_2B + BATTING_3B + BATTING_HR + 
##     BATTING_BB + BATTING_SO + BASERUN_SB + BASERUN_CS + PITCHING_H + 
##     PITCHING_HR + PITCHING_BB + PITCHING_SO + FIELDING_E + FIELDING_DP + 
##     BATTING_1B
## 
## Complete :
##            (Intercept) BATTING_H BATTING_2B BATTING_3B BATTING_HR BATTING_BB
## BATTING_1B  0           1        -1         -1         -1          0        
##            BATTING_SO BASERUN_SB BASERUN_CS PITCHING_H PITCHING_HR PITCHING_BB
## BATTING_1B  0          0          0          0          0           0         
##            PITCHING_SO FIELDING_E FIELDING_DP
## BATTING_1B  0           0          0
```

```r
# vif(lm(TARGET_WINS~.,moneyball_train[,-c(2,3,4,5)]))

corrplot(cor(mtd),type = 'upper')
```

![](HomeWork1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
# dput(model1)
```

Result shows that `BATTING_1B` is correlated with `BATTING_H`, `BATTING_2B`,`BATTING_3B`, `BATTING_HR`. Here `+1` and `-1` are indicative of sign of coeffecient of the repitive predictor while stating the value for `BATTING_1B`. 

Corrplot also suggest the same except, it doesn't show high correlation between `BATTING_H``BATTING_HR`. In our Model2 , we will just follow the p-value significance test and build the model. 


```r
# Make predictions
predictions <- model1 %>% predict(moneyball_test)

# Model performance
data.frame(
  RMSE = RMSE(predictions, moneyball_test$TARGET_WINS,na.rm = TRUE),
  R2 = R2(predictions,moneyball_test$TARGET_WINS,na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">
  <script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["RMSE"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["R2"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"9.804207","2":"0.4255646"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>

### Model 2

Here `alias` doesn't suggest any correlated predictor. Now we can run VIF (variance inflation factor), which measures how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity in the model.
The smallest possible value of VIF is one (absence of multicollinearity). Here we will look for VIF value, if that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity. "Read More"['http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/39-regression-model-diagnostics/160-multicollinearity-essentials-and-vif-in-r/']


```r
alias(model2)
```

```
## Model :
## TARGET_WINS ~ BATTING_H + BATTING_3B + BATTING_HR + BATTING_BB + 
##     BATTING_SO + BASERUN_SB + PITCHING_SO + PITCHING_H + PITCHING_SO + 
##     FIELDING_E + FIELDING_DP
```

```r
vif(model2)
```

```
##   BATTING_H  BATTING_3B  BATTING_HR  BATTING_BB  BATTING_SO  BASERUN_SB 
##   23.591594    2.924829    4.274146    1.259010  242.802006    1.539592 
## PITCHING_SO  PITCHING_H  FIELDING_E FIELDING_DP 
##  225.307718   48.406757    2.835717    1.353810
```

VIF output suggest that BATTING_H, PITCHING_H, BATTING_SO,PITCHING_SO are highly impacting model due their colinear relation.

Lets only consider Model with beter RMSE and R2 and check it with AIC test:

| Model Name | RMSE    | R^2     |
|------------|---------|---------|
| model1     | 9.80421 | 0.42556 |
| model2     | 10.2591 | 0.38835 |
| model3     | 10.0631 | 0.40604 |
| model4     | 9.92225 | 0.41098 |
| model5     | 9.99109 | 0.40295 |
| Step Back  | 9.77083 | 0.428734|

Lets run the AIC weight test to evaluate the best model out of few selected models :


```r
bbmle::AICctab(step_back,model4,model5,delta=TRUE, weights=TRUE)
```

```
##           dAICc df weight
## step_back   0.0 35 1     
## model4    106.9 13 <0.001
## model5    106.9 11 <0.001
```

In Both test  `Model1` is doing well, but since its not a parsomonious model we decided to check among `model4` and `model5` and `step_back`. Which is a parsomonious model, with no multicolnearity among the predictors. 
We also note how multicolinearity in models were impacting its effect on overall perfromcne of the model.

Selected Model = `step_back`

## Predict of Eval data

Run the `step_backward` model on Eval data.

```r
model <- lm(BATTING_H~., data=med)

data.table(cbind(data.table("Predicted"= predict(step_back,med)),med))
```

# CONCLUSION

This report covers an attempt to build a model to predict number of wins of a baseball team in a season based on several offensive and deffensive statistics. Resulting model explained about 36% of variability in the target variable and included most of the provided explanatory variables. Some potentially helpful variables were not included in the data set. For instance, number of At Bats can be used to calculate on-base percentage which may correlate strongly with winning percentage. The model can be revised with additional variables or further analysis.
